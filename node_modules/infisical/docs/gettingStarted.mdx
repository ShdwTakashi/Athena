## Introduction

Infisical works by injecting environment variables into your application process. Because of this, Infisical works for all programing languages and platforms.

Infisical is powered by public-key cryptography to ensure that you are the only person who can access your secrets. Read more about our security [here](https://dub.sh/XocpMvT)

### Step 1: Make an account

Head to [https://infisical.com](https://infisical.com/) to make an account and create a project. Once you've made an account, you'll be prompted to a dashboard with some placeholder environment variables. Go ahead and replace the placeholder environment variables with your environment variables from your .env file.

### Step 2 (Optional): Invite your dev team

Navigate to the “Team” tab in the left sidebar and invite your teammates to the project by submitting their emails. They'll each receive an email invitation to join the project and get access to the environment variables. A few things to note about invitations due to how our public-key cryptography works:

- If a teammate is already registered with Infisical, then they'll receive access to the environment variables immediately.
- If a teammate is unregistered with Infisical, then they'll have to request access to the environment variables once they've registered.

### Step 3: Install the CLI
The Infisical CLI will allow you to inject secrets into any environment. This includes both your local and production environments.
