## Background

To authenticate the Infisical CLI in environments other than your local desktop environment, you will have to utilize the Infisical Token. 
The Infisical Token is a quick and easy way to authenticate the CLI without having to type in your email and password. This is especially needed
in production environments where you cannot type in your login details. 

With the Infisical Token, you can allow read only access to a particular environment (dev, prod, etc.) for a given project for a set amount of time. Once the token expires, any CLI application 
that relies on it for authentication will be denied access to retrieve the related secrets. 

## Generate a Infisical Token
To get started, navigate to your dashboard and select the project for which you would like to generate a Infisical Token for. 
Then head over to project settings and you should see a similar page like below.

To add a new Infisical Token, press the `add new token` button. This will bring up a page like below.

Enter a name to help you identify the token then choose the environment from which you would like the CLI to retrieve the secrets from. Lastly, choose a duration 
for the token.

<Info>
Once the token is expired, the CLI using it will no longer be able to make requests with it. 
</Info>


## Use Infisical token with CLI
Once you have generated a token, it is easy to tell the Infisical CLI to use it. 

### Feeding the token to the CLI 
The CLI looks out for an environment variable called `INFISICAL_TOKEN`. Setting this environment variable depends on where you run the CLI. 
For example, if you are running the CLI in a Docker container, you may set the environment variable via the docker run command like so. 

Docker run example:
```
 docker run --env INFISICAL_TOKEN=<the token you generated>...
```

<Warning>
In the event your token is exposed, visit the project settings page again and deactivate the token to expire it immediately. 
</Warning>

### Prepare `infisical run` command

Once you have exposed the `INFISICAL_TOKEN` environment variable to the environment the CLI is running in you can prepare the run command.
To have the CLI authenticate via the Infisical Token, you must provide values for flags `--stage` and `--projectId`

Example:
```
infisical run --stage=prod --projectId=<the project id for the token you generated>
```

<Info>
  Notice that we do not need to run any other command such as `infisical init` or `infisical login` when we use the Infisical Token.
</Info>
